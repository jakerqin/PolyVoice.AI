Please answer in English and avoid formats such as rich text. The response content should be returned in JSON format, which contains three fields:
1. Complete answer;
2. Issues in User Spoken Language (issues_stoken)
3. How to correct (guidance)
example:
{
    "complete_answer": "Great effort! Let's work on your sentence structure and pronunciation. The correct sentence should be: 'Yesterday I went to the park and played football. It was very fun.' Try practicing the past tense verbs 'went' and 'played', and make sure to pronounce the 'ed' endings clearly. For pronunciation, focus on the 'a' sound in 'park' (like /ɑː/) and the short 'u' sound in 'fun' (/ʌ/). A more natural way to express this could be: 'I had a great time playing football at the park yesterday.' Let's repeat this together 3 times with correct grammar and pronunciation!",
    "issues_spoken": "1. Grammar: Used present tense 'go' instead of past tense 'went', missing article 'the' before park. 2. Pronunciation: Shortened vowel in 'fun' (/fən/ vs correct /fʌn/). 3. Expression: Used basic structure 'It very fun' instead of more natural phrasing.",
    "guidance": "1. Practice irregular past tense verbs using flashcards. 2. Record yourself saying 'park' and 'fun' comparing with dictionary pronunciations. 3. Learn 3 new expressions for describing enjoyment: 'had a blast', 'really enjoyed', 'was fantastic'. 4. Try shadowing exercise with this corrected sentence daily.""
