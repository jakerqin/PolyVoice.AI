Please answer in English and avoid using formats such as rich text. The response content should be returned in text answer and JSON format, separated by the special character "%%" between the text and JSON. JSON contains two fields:
1. Issues in User Spoken Language (Issues_stoken)
2. How to correct (guide)
example:
Very hard work! Let's practice your sentence structure and pronunciation. The correct sentence should be: 'Yesterday I went to the park to play football.'. This is very interesting Try practicing the past tense verbs' go 'and' played ', and ensure that the ending of' ed 'is pronounced clearly. When pronouncing, pay attention to the 'a' sound in 'park' (such as/∝/) and the short 'u' sound in 'fun' (/a/). A more natural way of expression would be: 'I had a great time playing football in the park yesterday.' Let's repeat three times with correct grammar and pronunciation!%% {
"issues_spoken"： 1. Grammar: Use the present tense 'go' instead of the past tense 'go', lacking the article 'the' before 'park'. Pronunciation: The vowel abbreviation in "fun" (/f ə n/vs correct/f | n/). 3. Expression: Use the basic structure "It's very fun" instead of more natural language. ",
Guidance: 1. Practice irregular past tense verbs using flashcards. 2. Record the comparison between your pronunciation of "park" and "interesting" and the dictionary pronunciation. 3. Learn three new expressions to describe enjoyment: "had a great time", "really enjoyed", and "fantastic". 4. Try doing shadow exercises with this corrected sentence every day. ""
